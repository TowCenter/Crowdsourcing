Places like Gawker, BuzzFeed, and Medium have all created efforts that include asking for audience members to contribute with stories of their own. While we have opted not to include these examples because they do not fit our definition of crowdsourcing (these asks do not necessarily lead to new acts of journalism), we do find them to be important examples of the growing trend within journalism of involving audience members earlier and more deeply within the story-making and storytelling processes.}},
